      <h1><a href="https://dynamis.gg/fru/p2/">Phase 2: Usurper of Frost</a></h1>

    


<p>As soon as <mark class="hl-mob">Fatebreaker</mark> dies, the arena transitions to <mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark>’s arena from

<abbr title="Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage)">E8S</abbr>, and <mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark> herself appears.
Although she looks the same, Ryne is possessed by Mitron
and is called the <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper of Frost</mark>.
But everyone still calls her <mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark>.</p>
<p>This phase is the closest that FRU has to a trio phase, with two long downtime mechanics.
Unlike a traditional trio phase, however, there is a little bit of uptime mechanic sprinkled in.
To complete the phase, she must be brought down below 20% health before the end of the enrage.
Also, unlike in the original fight, the edge of the arena is not a cliff
but stays as the traditional Ultimate deathwall.</p>
<p>As before, unless otherwise noted, any attack
other than a spread, stack, raidwide, or tankbuster inflicts <span class="buff" >

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p><mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark> kicks things off with <mark class="hl-cast">Quadruple Slap</mark>,
a tankbuster that only actually has two hits.
It’s a typical one-two buster with room for a tank swap.
It inflicts a cleansable <span class="buff" >

            <span class="buff-duration">15</span>
    </span>
        <span class="buff-name">Physical Vulnerability Up</span>
</span>,
forcing a swap, cleanse, or invuln.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#fn-3">1</a></sup></p>
<p>After one follow-up auto—which can also be lethal, thanks to the vuln—<mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark>
teleports to south of center, faces north, and begins casting <mark class="hl-cast">Mirror Image</mark>.
This cast has no associated attack, but summons a <mark class="hl-light">light-form</mark> clone,
the <mark class="hl-mob">Oracle&#x27;s Reflection</mark>, directly in the center of the arena.
The <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper of Frost</mark> herself remains in <mark class="hl-ice">ice form</mark>.
The two of them will bounce around a lot during the next mechanic.</p>
<h2 id="sequence-1-diamond-dust">Sequence 1: Diamond Dust</h2>
<h3 id="aoe-hell">AoE Hell</h3>
<p>Once the <mark class="hl-mob">Reflection</mark> appears, <mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark> casts <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark>,
a raidwide that kicks off the real mechanic.
Note that the raidwide is slightly delayed from the end of the cast.
Don’t mitigate too early.
<mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark> herself disappears, kicking off the long downtime mechanic.</p>
<p>Three different things happen in rapid succession:</p>
<ol>
<li>It wouldn’t be a Shiva fight without the classic circular AoEs
around the oustide of the arena.</li>
<li>The <mark class="hl-mob">Oracle&#x27;s Reflection</mark> begins casting
either <mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark> or <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark>.</li>
<li>Four players–all <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark> or all <mark class="hl-support">supports</mark>–are
targeted by markers with a circular yellow omen.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these mechanics, and more, need to be solved simultaneously.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<abbr title="Puddle telegraphing an upcoming AoE">Omens</abbr> for the classic circle AoEs—the true
<mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark>—appear in the 
<abbr title="Cardinals or intercardinals">principal directions</abbr> in three waves.
The first wave has two circles, appearing opposite one another.</p>
<p>The second wave spreads out from the first wave:
If the first wave was on a pair of cardinals,
then the second wave will be on the four intercardinals.
Conversely, if the first wave was on intercardinals,
then the second wave will be on the four cardinals.</p>
<p>The third wave will hit the two remaining cardinals or intercardinals,
at 90° from the first wave.
All three waves must be completely dodged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <mark class="hl-mob">Oracle&#x27;s Reflection</mark>’s cast will be either
a point-blank (<mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark>) or a donut (<mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark>).
These AoEs are very big:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The point-blank <mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark> goes all the way out to the outer
line<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-4-1"><a href="#fn-4">2</a></sup> on the floor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The donut <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> extends
to well within the <mark class="hl-mob">Reflection</mark>’s hitbox.
The safe area is only as wide as the small four-pointed star within the inner circle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The two attacks can be distinguished by her voice line: <mark class="hl-light">Axe Kick</mark>
is accompanied by “Cleave!”, and <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> by “Reap!”</p>
<p>At the same time as the point-blank or donut,
the <mark class="hl-mob">Reflection</mark> also shoots out four <mark class="hl-light">The House of Light</mark> cones
at the four nearest players,
These cones, combined with the four marker AoEs, create an 8-way spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four circular markers go off moments after the kick,
hitting their targets with <mark class="hl-ice">Frigid Stone</mark>
at the same time as the first <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark> circles go off.
These drop a second set of AoEs, 8-way lines,
with the omens appearing a few seconds after the <mark class="hl-ice">Frigid Stones</mark> hit.
These 8-way lines are similar to the ones during <mark class="hl-cast">Icelit Dragonsong</mark>
in phase 2 of 
<abbr title="Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage)">E8S</abbr>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <mark class="hl-mob">Oracle&#x27;s Reflection</mark> moves out towards a principal direction
and begins casting <mark class="hl-light">Sinbound Holy</mark>,
while the <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper of Frost</mark> reappears in the center of the arena.
You will likely want to pay attention to the <mark class="hl-mob">Reflection</mark>’s location,
as it’s important later.</p>
<p>Without any warning, the <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper</mark> performs <mark class="hl-ice">Heavenly Strike</mark>,
a knockback raidwide, and disappears.
This is the point where the second set of <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark> AoEs go off.
You must get knocked back into a spot that’s safe from both the line AoEs
and <mark class="hl-ice">Diamond Dust</mark>,
with the final circles going off almost simultaneous with the lines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After all of this, it isn’t even over.</p>
<h3 id="thin-ice">Thin Ice</h3>
<p>Right after the lines go off, <mark class="hl-light">Sinbound Holy</mark> targets both <mark class="hl-healer">healers</mark>
with four 
<abbr title="Shared-damage stacks meant for a light party, i.e. 4 players">LP stacks</abbr> each, in quick succession.
Each hit leaves behind a puddle that inflicts <span class="buff" >
    <span class="buff-icon"
      data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-custom-class="blockdiv"
      data-bs-title="

                <hr>
            <div class='buff-explanation'> <p>This is a <em>massive</em> dot as a penalty for standing in a Sinbound Holy puddle.
It is so strong that it typically one-shots.</p>
<p>Technically, it is two separate debuffs.
The first one has indefinite duration, but when it ticks it replaces itself with a 30-second version.</p>

    </span>
        <span class="buff-name">Bleeding</span>
</span>,
forcing the party to keep moving.</p>
<p>As players run away from <mark class="hl-light">Sinbound Holy</mark>,
the <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper of Frost</mark> moves to the edge of the arena,
in a random 
<abbr title="Cardinal or intercardinal">principal direction</abbr>.</p>
<p>About 4 seconds after the last puddle drops, without any other warning,
she uses <mark class="hl-ice">Shining Armor</mark>.
This is a gaze attack that inflicts <span class="buff" >
    <span class="buff-icon"

            <span class="buff-duration">8</span>
    </span>
        <span class="buff-name">Stun</span>
</span>.
The stun will make impossible to pass the next part of the mechanic,
so you can’t look at <mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark> no matter how hot she is.</p>
<p>Additionally, the arena will become <span class="buff" >
    <span class="buff-icon"
      data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-custom-class="blockdiv"
      data-bs-title="

    </span>
</span> icy.
Moving will now send a player sliding most of the way across the arena.
Two bosses will also swap appearances.
The <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper of Frost</mark> changes to <mark class="hl-light">light form</mark>,
and will remain so for the rest of the phase,
at the same time as the <mark class="hl-mob">Oracle&#x27;s Reflection</mark> changes to <mark class="hl-ice">ice form</mark>.</p>
<h3 id="stillness-silence">Stillness &amp; Silence</h3>
<p>The <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper</mark> will disappear while the <mark class="hl-mob">Reflection</mark> begins casting
either <mark class="hl-ice">Twin Stillness</mark> or <mark class="hl-ice">Twin Silence</mark>.
Which attack she is using is also telegraphed by her voice line (and accompanying caption):
either <mark class="hl-ice">&quot;In stillness freeze!&quot;</mark> or <mark class="hl-ice">&quot;Sink into silence!&quot;</mark></p>
<p>If she uses <mark class="hl-ice">Stillness</mark>, she will first cleave a massive 270° in front of her,
leaving only a small safe area behind.
She will then cleave 90° her, hitting exactly the small area that was just safe.
If she uses <mark class="hl-ice">Silence</mark>, she does the exact opposite,
first with a small cleave behind then a very large cleave in front.
Both cleaves are one-shots.</p>
<p>The snapshot on the first attack is right at the end of the first cast bar,
with the second coming earlier than you might expect.
In practice, the long slide required to get behind her,
versus the short slide to get in front of her,
mean that you have to move slightly earlier for <mark class="hl-ice">Stillness</mark>.</p>
<p>The sequence finally wraps up as the <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper of Frost</mark> reappears, targetable,
in the center of the arena.</p>
<h2 id="sequence-2-mirror-mirror">Sequence 2: Mirror, Mirror</h2>
<h3 id="hallowed-ray">Hallowed Ray</h3>
<p>Immediately after reappearing, the <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper</mark> begins casting <mark class="hl-cast">Hallowed Ray</mark>.
This is a 
<abbr title="A shared-damage stack meant for the entire party">full-party stack</abbr> line 
<abbr title="Area of Effect">AoE</abbr> on a random player.</p>
<p>The only thing of note is that the attack direction snapshots quite early,
so it’s actually possible for the targeted player to dodge it entirely.
This is not consistent, however, so it can’t be used to avoid the mechanic.</p>
<h3 id="mirror-mirror">Mirror, Mirror</h3>
<p>Her next cast is <mark class="hl-cast">Mirror, Mirror</mark>.
This move summons three <mark class="hl-mob">Frozen Mirror</mark>s around the edge of the arena at

<abbr title="Cardinals or intercardinals">principal directions</abbr>.
There will be two red mirrors and one blue mirror.
The red mirrors will always be 90° apart,
but the blue mirror can be anywhere, including in between them.</p>
<p>The <mark class="hl-mob">Usurper</mark> begins casting <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> which is the same as before:
a large donut with a very small hole,
and four protean cones at the nearest four players.
At exactly the same time, however, the blue mirror will also use the exact same move.
Since <mark class="hl-light">Scythe Kick</mark> on its own is a four-way spread,
two copies of it make for an eight-way spread.</p>
<p>Right afterwards, the two red mirrors cast <mark class="hl-light">Reflected Scythe Kick</mark>.
Unsurprisingly, this is the exact same move.
But it must be solved so that none of the players clip each other.</p>
<p>Each of the mirrors disappears shortly after</p>
<h3 id="banish-iii">Banish III</h3>
<p><mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark>’s last cast in this segment is <mark class="hl-cast">Banish III</mark>,
which she begins casting right as the <mark class="hl-light">Reflected Scythe Kicks</mark>
During the cast, she’ll have a ring of light above her head,
with either a single orb or four orbs orbiting on it.</p>
<p>If there’s only one orb, the attack is a 
<abbr title="A shared-damage stack meant for 2 players">pair stack</abbr> targeted on <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark>.
If there’s four, it’s a spread targeted on <mark class="hl-dps">DPS</mark>.
Unlike in 
<abbr title="Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage)">E8S</abbr>, there are no indicators over individual players’ heads.</p>
<h2 id="sequence-3-light-rampant">Sequence 3: Light Rampant</h2>
<p>The infamous mechanic from 
<abbr title="Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage)">E8S</abbr> is back, although it’s arguably not even as bad.
Naturally enough,
it kicks off with a teleport to center and the <mark class="hl-light">Light Rampant</mark> castbar.
There’s a raidwide on this one, so make sure mits and shields are up.</p>
<p>This mechanic makes use of the <span class="buff" >

<p>The phase ends with <mark class="hl-mob">Shiva</mark> casting <mark class="hl-ice">Absolute Zero</mark>, the enrage.
If the party does not bring her below 20% HP before it completes,
it deals infinite damage and wipes the party.
If she is brought below 20%, however, it is only a heavy raidwide.
As the transition to the intermission begins, she knocks every back from the center,
so don’t stand too far out and get pushed into the wall.</p>

<p>It was initially believed that they could never spawn in with two tethers crossed,
however, this was shown to be untrue.</p>
<p>Our best theory on the actual mechanics of the tethers is that,
after two players are randomly chosen as the marker players,
one player is randomly chosen as the starting player for the tethers.
This player is tethered to the closest player (without a marker),
who is then tethered to the next closest player,
and so on, until everyone either has a marker or a tether,
and then one more tether is added to close the loop.
The orbs go out to two random tethered players. <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>
