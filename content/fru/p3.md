# UNDER CONSTRUCTION MAY BE INACURAT AND INKOMPLETE

After the Ice Veil is broken and the intermission is completed,
enjoy a long break through the lead-in of The Extreme
as Gaia is possessed by Loghrif's memories
and takes up her role as the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}}.

As you might expect, this phase reprises mechanics from phase 2 of {{gloss(k="E12S")}}.
It's a straightforward full-uptime phase where, again,
you need to get the boss below 20% before enrage to proceed to the next phase.

## Intro

After the 37 seconds or so of downtime for the transition,
the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}}---or just {{mob(n="Gaia")}}, as everyone calls
her---becomes targetable.
She kicks things off with {{cast(n="Hell's Judgment")}},
which inflicts damage on everyone equal to their HP-1, ignoring migitation and shields.

The usual effect of this is to set everyone to 1,
but there's a brief gap between the moment when damage is computed and when it's applied.
If your current HP changes in this time, you won't go to exactly 1.
Pay careful attention to the cooldowns of Max HP-increasing abilities,
as it's possible to die if they fall off after the snapshot.

## Sequence 1: Ultimate Relativity

The first sequence is {{cast(n="Ultimate Relativity")}},
with its classically over-the-top cast animation.
The cast is a raidwide in addition to starting the mechanic off,
but unlike the {{cast(n=("Relativity"))}} casts from E12S,
it seems like it is simply a normal raidwide rather than shared damage.[^2]
The message "The laws of time are in chaos!" appears on the screen,
although it's purely for flavour.

The arena floor changes from dark blue to a bright teal colour for the duration of the mechanic,
but this is a purely cosmetic effect.

### Spells-in-Waiting

What's *actually* in chaos is everyone's debuff bars, as everyone receives three spells-in-waiting.
From left to right on the debuff bar, they are as follows:

1. Every player receives a 10-, 20-, or 30-second {{buff(b="siw-fire", short=true)}}
   or {{buff(b="siw-ice", short=true)}}:
    1. Two {{supp(t="supports")}} and one {{dps()}}
       each receive {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=30)}}.
    2. One {{supp()}} and one {{dps()}} each receive {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=20)}}.
    3. Two {{dps()}} and one {{supp()}} each receive {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=10)}}.
    4. I lied a little bit.
       Either the {{supp()}} with {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=10, short=true)}}
       or the {{dps()}} with {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=30, short=true)}}
       *actually* receives {{buff(b="siw-ice", dur=20)}} instead.

    However, for the rest of the debuff breakdown,
    I'm going to pretend the {{buff(b="siw-ice", short=true)}} doesn't exist,
    and all players receive {{buff(b="siw-fire", short=true)}}.
    It simplifies the explanations.

1. Every player receives a 16- or 26-second {{buff(b="siw-return", short=true)}}.
    1. The three players with {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=30, short=true)}} receive
       {{buff(b="siw-return", dur=26)}},
    2. The other five players receive {{buff(b="siw-return", dur=16)}}.

1. Every player receives a 43-second {{buff(b="siw-gaze", short=true)}},
   {{buff(b="siw-water", short=true)}}, or {{buff(b="siw-dark", short=true)}}:
    1. The three players with {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=30, short=true)}} receive
       {{buff(b="siw-gaze", dur=43)}}.
    2. The {{dps()}} with {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=20, short=true)}} receives
       {{buff(b="siw-water", dur=43)}}.
    3. The remaining four players all receive {{buff(b="siw-dark", dur=43)}}.

It perhaps comes as a bit of a surprise how tightly role-based the assignments are,
given that this is an ultimate.
Thankfully, though, it means that everything can be summarized in a single small table:

| Role    | 2×  | 1×  | 1×  |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| {{supp(t="Support")}} | {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=30, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-return", dur=26, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-gaze", dur=43, short=true)}} | {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=20, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-return", dur=16, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-dark", dur=43, short=true)}} | ({{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=10, short=true)}}/{{buff(b="siw-ice", dur=20, short=true)}}){{buff(b="siw-return", dur=16, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-dark", dur=43, short=true)}} |
| {{dps()}} | {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=10, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-return", dur=16, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-gaze", dur=43, short=true)}} | {{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=20, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-return", dur=16, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-water", dur=43, short=true)}} | ({{buff(b="siw-ice", dur=20, short=true)}}/{{buff(b="siw-fire", dur=30, short=true)}}){{buff(b="siw-return", dur=26, short=true)}}{{buff(b="siw-gaze", dur=43, short=true)}} |

When {{buff(b="siw-return")}} expires,
the position of its bearer will be recorded with a blue marker,
and the bearer will receive {{buff(b="return")}}.
The duration of the {{buff(b="return")}} debuff will be either 24 or 14 seconds,
so that the {{buff(b="return", short=true)}} expires 40 seconds after the start of the mechanic.

[^2]: If anyone can actually *confirm* this, it would be appreciated,
      as currently all I have is one person who said they "Don't think it is."

### Hourglasses

In addition to the debuffs, {{cast(n="Ultimate Relativity")}} summons
eight {{mob(n="Delight's Hourglass")}}, one on each {{gloss(k="principal direction")}}.
Because of their three-lobed appearance, and the various colours they had in E12S,
they're often called "traffic lights" in the community.[^1]
They are all green in this fight, however, so the anology doesn't work so well.

Right after the {{mob(n="Hourglasses")}} appear, {{mob(n="Gaia")}} casts {{cast(n="Speed")}}.
As she does so, three {{light(t="yellow")}} lines
and two {{dark(t="purple")}} lines---with bright orbs in the middle---connect
her to some of the {{mob(n="Hourglasses")}}.
Although the orientation is random, the pattern is always the same:
the three {{light(t="yellow")}} lines make a {{light(t="Y shape")}},
while the two {{dark(t="purple")}} lines are {{dark(t="horizontal")}} relative to the Y.
Note that {{mob(n="Gaia")}} herself does not change facing during this cast.

The effect of {{cast(n="Speed")}} is
to set up the order in which the {{mob(n="Hourglasses")}} use their one attack,
{{cast(n="Sinbound Meltdown")}}.
The {{light(t="yellow")}}-marked {{mob(n="Hourglasses")}} make up the {{light(t="first wave")}},
the unmarked ones the {{cast(n="second wave")}},
and the {{dark(t="purple")}} ones the {{dark(t="third wave")}}.
The three waves happen approximately 16, 26, and 36 seconds after the start of the mechanic,
with the first two corresponding to the expiry of the {{buff(b="siw-return")}} debuffs.

As the {{mob(n="Hourglasses")}} cast {{cast(n="Sinbound Meltdown")}},
there is an advance warning with either a clockwise {{light(t="yellow")}} indicator,
or a counterclockwise {{water(t="blue")}} indicator,
randomly selected for each {{mob(n="Hourglass")}}.
This indicates the direction the attack will rotate.

The attack itself is a laser
targeted on the nearest player to the {{mob(n="Hourglass")}} in question.
Two seconds later, the second laser fires, rotated a bit in the direction indicated.
Eight more follow, one second apart, creating a total arc of roughly 120° across ten shots.[^3]

[^1]: Also, absolutely no one looks at these things and thinks "hourglass!"
      Seriously, what good is a three-chambered hourglass?
[^3]: Exact angle measurements would be appreciated, if anyone has them.

### Overall Timeline

To come...

At the end of the sequence,
{{mob(n="Gaia")}} casts {{cast(n="Shockwave Pulsar")}}, a heavy raidwide,
followed by {{cast(n="Black Halo")}}, a 2-stack tankbuster.

## Sequence 2: Sextuple Apocalypse

To come...

## Enrage

{{mob(n="Gaia")}} casts {{cast(n="Shockwave Pulsar")}} a second time
before diving into {{cast(n="Memory's End")}}, her enrage cast.
Get her below 20% HP before the end of the castbar to turn it into "only" a heavy raidwide,
and clear the phase.

In E12S, the enrage cast was notable for traveling relatively slowly out from the center,
allowing players to put distance between them and the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}}
in order to get an extra fraction of a second.
That niche strat unfortunately isn't applicable here,
as whether or not you advance to the next phase is determined when the cast goes off.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to {{mob(n="Silent Bramble")}}, {{mob(n="Evansith")}},
whoever worked out the debuff assignment pattern for {{cast(n="Ultimate Relativity")}},
and all the usual suspects.
