After completing phase 4 with both
the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} and the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}} dying,
the two will become balls of {{light()}} and {{dark(t="darkness")}} and merge together.

If the {{mob(n="Fragment of Fate")}} did *not* survive phase 4 intact---or
if it never spawned because the {{mob(n="Eternal Ice Fragment")}} wasn't saved
in the crystal intermission---then the transition to the bad ending will *not* be a cutscene
and players will retain control of their characters.
The phase 5 arena will appear, and the {{mob(n="Guardian of Eden")}} appears
at the north side of the arena.
It immediately casts {{cast(n="Paradise Lost")}}, wiping the party.

If the {{mob(n="Fragment of Fate")}} *did* survive phase 4,
then the transition is a cutscene in which Ryne and Gaia's memories fight Mitron for control.
The result is Ryne and Gaia's merged form, {{mob(n="Pandora")}},[^1]
the final boss of Futures Rewritten.
Players will be knocked back to south of center and given {{buff(b="down-for-the-count")}}
for the minute-long (yes, really) cutscene.
The arena transitions to the phase 1 arena from {{gloss(k="E12S")}},
with Ryne and Gaia's memories showing in the background,
and Return to Oblivion kicks in.
The {{buff(b="down-for-the-count", short=true)}} fades as the final fight begins.

Note that throughout this phase, {{mob(n="Pandora")}} attacks with
{{light()}} on her {{light(t="left side")}} and
{{dark()}} on her {{dark(t="right side")}}.
This orientation is based on her wings and never changes.

[^1]: Interestingly, in Japanese she's called
{{mob(n="Pandora Mitron")}} ({{mob(n="パンドラ・ミトロン")}}),
which comes off quite differently, ね?
The name is a reference to the Lunatic Pandora from FF8.

## Sequence 1: Fulgent Blade

{{mob(n="Pandora")}} kicks things off with {{cast(n="Fulgent Blade")}},
a raidwide that causes six lines of light and darkness to appear on the ground.
The pattern of the lines is always the same,
although the positioning can vary so it might look different sometimes.
The six lines are always offset 45° from one another,
making a sort of 3/4 circle around the middle of the arena.

These are all {{gloss(k="exalines")}} that detonate two at a time,
moving outwards from their lines of origin.
Starting from one side of the 3/4-circle,
the outermost two lines on one side will detonate,
then the middle two,
then finally the two on the other side.
Each pair will be arranged so that the lines from the light and dark sides cross.

Before each line explodes, an {{gloss(k="omen")}} appears showing the upcoming explosion,
with many arrows indicating that the line {{gloss(k="AoEs")}} are going to move.
The first two {{gloss=(k="exalines")}} go off, and then they repeat in the directions indicated,
perpendicular to the original line they came from.
There are no omens for the subsequent explosions.

The detonations go as follows:

|      | First Wave     | Second Wave    | Third Wave     | Pandora |
| ---: | :--------:     | :---------:    | :--------:     | ------: |
| 1.   | Omens appear   |                |                |         |
| 2.   | 1st explosions |                |                |         |
| 3.   | 2nd explosions | Omens appear   |                |         |
| 4.   | 3rd explosions | 1st explosions |                |         |
| 5.   | 4th explosions | 2nd explosions | Omens appear   | Lock direction |
| 6.   | 5th explosions | 3rd explosions | 1st explosions | {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}} castbar |
| 7.   | 6th explosions | 4th explosions | 2st explosions | {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}} castbar |
| 8.   | 7th explosions | 5th explosions | 3rd explosions | {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}} castbar |
| 8.   | 8th explosions | 6th explosions | 4th explosions | {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}} castbar |
| 8.   |                | 7th explosions | 5th explosions | {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}} |

Each exaline will have a total of 8 waves of explosions,
although only the first few are typically relevant.

Being hit by an exaline will likely not kill a topped player,
but it will inflict both {{buff(b="ddown", dur="2m")}} and
either {{buff(b="lvuln", dur=15)}} or {{buff(b="dvuln", dur=15)}},
giving vulnerability to the *opposite* element of the line that hit.

This is a bit hard to visualize without an image,
so I will try to come back and add one,
but for now text will have to do.

**tl;dr:** It's three waves of exalines at funny angles.

### Akh Morn

At about the same time as the fifth set of explosions from the last wave of exalines---or
the ninth set of explosions overall---{{mob(n="Pandora)}}
will start casting {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}}.
This time, {{cast(n="Akh Morn")}} is a simple {{gloss(k="LP stack")}},
with no penalty for understacking.

The only catch is the targeting condition:
One random player on her {{light(t="left side")}} is targeted by a {{light(t="light explosion")}},
and one random player on her {{dark(t="right")}} is targeted by a {{dark(t="dark explosion")}}.
If no player is on the correct side, it targets a random player on the other side instead.
Her position locks in at the start of the cast, so players need to position themselves afterwards.

## Sequence 2: Paradise Regained

Just before the last (irrelevant) exalines denotate,
{{mob(n="Pandora")}} centers, faces north, and starts casting {{cast(n="Paradise Regained")}}.
This kicks off the most complex of phase 5's three sequences.

When the cast completes, three 2-stack {{gloss(k="towers")}} begin appearing, one by one,
in an equilateral triangle around the center of the arena.
The towers always appear S, NW, and NE, but in a random order.
They will detonate in the order they appear.

As the second tower appears, {{mob(n="Pandora")}} begins casting {{cast(n="Wings Dark and Light")}},
and either her {{light(t="left wing")}} will start glowing with {{light()}},
or her {{dark(t="right wing")}} will start glowing with {{dark(t="darkness")}}.
The {{light(t="farthest")}} or {{dark(t="nearest")}} player,
other than the main tank (or, more specifically, whoever has top {{gloss(k="enmity")}}),
will get attached to her by a {{light()}} or {{dark()}} tether matching the wing.
About 2/3 of the way through the cast,
the third tower appears, and {{mob(n="Pandora")}}'s other wing starts glowing.
Her wing and tether attacks will follow the order that the wings glowed,
either {{light()}} then {{dark()}}, or {{dark()}} then {{light()}}.

## Sequence 3 Polarizing Strikes

## Pandora's Box

## Loop

From this point, the fight loops.
{{mob(n="Pandora")}} repeats the first three mechanics, {{cast(n="Fulgent Blade")}},
{{cast(n="Paradise Regained")}}, and {{cast(n="Polarizing Strikes")}}.
The only difference is that the mechanics come faster the second time,
and {{mob(n="Pandora")}} will not recenter before using {{cast(n="Polarizing Strikes")}}.
She will stay in the same position as
when she used the second cleave during {{cast(n="Paraise Regained")}}.

After this, she uses {{cast(n="Fulgent Blade")}} for a third time,
and this third instance is identical to the first two.

## Enrage

Finally, frustrated with her lack of progress, {{mob(n="Pandora")}} begins the enrage cast,
{{cast(n="Paradise Lost")}}.
From here on, it's simply a DPS check to free the gays and earn your totems.
But there is one last twist.

As the castbar reaches about 2/3 complete, Ryne will lend a bit of her strength,
filling the party's limit gauge by about 1 to 1 1/2 bars.
Assuming you haven't used a limit break since {{cast(n="Pandora's Box")}},
this will completely fill the gauge.
You now have a free shot at melee LB3, but act quick,
because the window of opportunity is very tight.
Even a few seconds of delay and the LB will not land before the enrage cast goes off.

Enjoy the spectacular enrage sequence, with rainbows *literally shooting off the lesbians*,
as you race the enrage.
If you don't make it, there's a brief post-death cutscene.

If you do make it, however, enjoy the final cutscene of the fight
and the loving gazes of XIV's favourite roommates,
followed by a background that will make all the gposers jealous.

And then go get one of the sickets weapons in the game
and turn on sweet sweet that "Genesis of Legends" title.

You've earned it.
