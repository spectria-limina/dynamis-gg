Thanks for reading these guides; I appreciate the support.

This page is just to outline a few of my future plans for these guides, in case you're curious.

* **Move them to NAUR:** NAUR is working on a new website
  that will be the future home of these guides.
* **Images:** We need pictures to show all the mechanics. I'm just really bad with pictures.
* **More Timelines:** I'm not sure any more mechanics need detailed timelines
  like UR, apoc, and CT have.
  Maybe DD.
  But I would like to include a full-fight timeline at least.
* **Damage breakdown:** Every source of damage should be catalogued and fully documented,
  both for mit planning and to help understand mistakes in logs.
  I have no expertise in this.
