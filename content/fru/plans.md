Thanks for reading these guides; I appreciate the support.
I've received a lot of compliments for these guides,
and hope to improve them and make more quality content in the future.
If you enjoyed the guides, please get in touch and let me know!
That's what gives me motivation.
I am, however, busy with law school, so I may not always get to them right away.

This page is just to outline a few of my future plans for these guides, in case you're curious.

* **Move them to NAUR:** NAUR is working on a new website
  that will be the future home of these guides.
* **Images:** We need pictures to show all the mechanics. I'm just really bad with pictures.
* **More Timelines:** I'm not sure any more mechanics need detailed timelines
  like UR, apoc, and CT have.
  Maybe DD.
  But I would like to include a full-fight timeline at least.
* **Damage breakdown:** Every source of damage should be catalogued and fully documented,
  both for mit planning and to help understand mistakes in logs.
  I have no expertise in this.
