As soon as {{mob(n="Fatebreaker")}} dies, the arena transitions to {{mob(n="Shiva")}}'s arena from
{{gloss(k="E8S")}}, and {{mob(n="Shiva")}} herself appears.
Although she looks the same, Ryne is possessed by Mitron
and is called the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}}.
But everyone still calls her {{mob(n="Shiva")}}.

This phase is the closejst that FRU has to a trio phase, with two long downtime mechanics.
Unlike a traditional trio phase, however, there is a little bit of uptime mechanic sprinkled in.

As before, unless otherwise noted, any attack
other than a spread, stack, raidwide, or tankbuster inflicts {{buff(b="ddown", dur="2m")}},
and all spreads and stacks inflict {{buff(b="mvuln", dur=2)}}
to prevent players from taking multiple hits.

## Intro

{{mob(n="Shiva")}} kicks things off with {{cast(n="Quadruple Slap")}},
a tankbuster that only actually has two hits.
It's a typical one-two buster with room for a tank swap.
It inflicts a {{buff(b="pvuln-esuna", dur=15)}},
giving you a rare chance to yell at the bard
when the main tank unexpectedly dies to the second hit.

After one follow-up auto—which can also be lethal, thanks to the vuln—{{mob(n="Shiva")}}
teleports to south of center, faces north, and begins casting {{cast(n="Mirror Image")}}.
This cast has no associated attack, but summons a light-form clone,
the {{mob(n="Oracle's Reflection")}}, directly in the center of the arena.
The two of them will bounce around a lot during the next mechanic.

## Sequence 1: Diamond Dust

Once the {{mob(n="Reflection")}} appears, {{mob(n="Shiva")}} casts {{cast(n="Diamond Dust")}},
a raidwide that kicks off the real mechanic.
Note that the raidwide is slightly delayed from the end of the cast.
Don't mitigate too early.
{{mob(n="Shiva")}} herself disappears, kicking off the long downtime mechanic.

Three different things happen in rapid succession:

1. It wouldn't be a Shiva fight without the classic circular AoEs
   around the oustide of the arena.
2. The {{mob(n="Oracle's Reflection")}} begins casting
   either {{cast(n="Axe Kick")}} or {{cast(n="Scythe Kick")}}.
3. Four players--all {{dps()}} or all {{supp(t="supports")}}--are
   targeted by markers with a circular yellow omen.

All of these mechanics, and more, need to be solved simultaneously.

1. {{gloss(k="Omens")}} for the classic circle AoEs
   appear in the {{gloss(k="principal directions")}} in three waves.
   The first wave has two circles, appearing opposite one another.

   The second wave spreads out from the first wave:
   If the first wave was on a pair of cardinals,
   then the second wave will be on the four intercardinals.
   Conversely, if the first wave was on intercardinals,
   then the second wave will be on the four cardinals.

   The third wave will hit the two remaining cardinals or intercardinals,
   at 90° from the first wave.
   All three waves must be completely dodged.

2. The {{mob(n="Oracle's Reflection")}}'s cast will be either
   a point-blank ({{cast(n="Axe Kick")}}) or a donut ({{cast(n="Scythe Kick")}}).
   These AoEs are very big:

      1. The point-blank {{cast(n="Axe Kick")}} goes all the way out to the outer
         {{gloss(t="line",exp="Sometimes the lines are circles")}} on the floor.
      2. The donut {{cast(n="Scythe Kick")}} extends
         to well within the {{mob(n="Reflection")}}'s hitbox.

   At the same time as the point-blank or donut,
   the {{mob(n="Reflection")}} also shoots out four {{cast(n="The House of Light")}} cones
   at the four nearest players,
   These cones, combined with the four marker AoEs, create an 8-way spread.

3. The four circular markers go off at the same as the kick,
   hitting their targets with {{cast(n="Frigid Stone")}}.
   These drop a second set of AoEs, 8-way lines,
   with the omens appearing a few seconds after the {{cast(n="Frigid Stones")}} hit.

4. The {{mob(n="Oracle's Reflection")}} moves out towards a principal direction
   and begins casting {{cast(n="Sinbound Holy")}},
   while the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} reappears in the center of the arena.
   You will likely want to pay attention to the {{mob(n="Reflection")}}'s location,
   as it's important later.

   Without any warning, the {{mob(n="Usurper")}} performs {{cast(n="Heavenly Strike")}},
   a knockback raidwide, and disappears.
   You must get knocked back into a spot that's safe from the line AoEs.

   Right after the lines go off,
   {{cast(n="Sinbound Holy")}} targets both {{healer(t="healers")}}
   with four {{gloss(k="LP stacks")}} each, in quick succession.
   Each hit leaves behind a puddle that inflicts {{buff(b="bleed-p2")}}, forcing the party to move.

After all of this, it isn't even over.

### Thin Ice

As players run away from {{cast(n="Sinbound Holy")}},
the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} moves to the edge of the arena,
in a random {{gloss(k="principal direction")}}.

About 4 seconds after the last puddle drops, without any other warning,
she uses {{cast(n="Shining Armor")}}.
This is a gaze attack that inflicts {{buff(b="ddown", dur="2m")}} and {{buff(b="stun", dur=8)}}.
The stun will make impossible to pass the next part of the mechanic,
so you can't look at {{mob(n="Shiva")}} no matter how hot she is.

Additionally, the arena will become {{buff(b="thin-ice", short=true)}} icy.
Moving will now send a player sliding most of the way across the arena.
Two bosses will also swap appearances.
The {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} changes to light form,
and will remain so for the rest of the phase,
while the {{mob(n="Oracle's Reflection")}} changes to ice form.

The {{mob(n="Usurper")}} will disappear while the {{mob(n="Reflection")}} begins casting
either {{cast(n="Twin Stillness")}} or {{cast(n="Twin Silence")}}.
Which attack she is using is also telegraphed by her voice line (and accompanying caption):
either "In stillness freeze!" or "Sink into silence!"

If she uses {{cast(n="Silence")}}, she will first cleave a massive 270° in front of her,
leaving only a small safe area behind.
She will then cleave 90° her, hitting exactly the small area that was just safe.
If she uses {{cast(n="Stillness")}}, she does the exact opposite,
first with a small cleave behind then a very large cleave in front.

The snapshot on these attacks is quite early, and in practice require slightly different timings.
When she uses {{cast(n="Stillness")}},
you will have to move slightly earlier because of the long slide to get to the safe area.

### Hallowed Ray

The sequence finally wraps up as the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} reappears,
targetable, in the center and begins casting {{cast(n="Hallowed Ray")}}.
This is a {{gloss(k="full-party stack")}} line {{gloss(k="AoE")}} on a random player.
The only thing of note is that the attack direction snapshots quite early,
so it's actually possible for the targeted player to dodge it entirely.
