After getting the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}} below 20% HP,
and surviving {{cast(n="Memory's End")}},
the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} will reappear at the south side of the arena.
She is immediately targetable.

This phase is a duo phase, with the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}} reappearing
shortly after the phase begins.
In order to complete the phase, both bosses must be defeated before the end of the enrage castbars.

## Materialization & Fragment of Fate

If the {{mob(n="Fragment of Eternity")}} was saved during the crystal intermission,
{{mob(n="Shiva")}}'s first cast is {{cast(n="Materialization")}}.

{{cast(n="Materialization")}} causes a {{mob(n="Fragment of Fate")}},
a crystal containing one of Gaia's memories,
to appear at the northern apex of the arena.
The {{mob(n="Fragment of Fate")}} has an HP bar
and periodically emits a raidwide called {{cast(n="Edge of Oblivion")}}.
If it is hit by any of the targeted or avoidable attacks in the phase, it will be destroyed;
otherwise it will survive the phase.

If it does not survive the phase, or is never summoned in the first place,
then the party will get the bad-ending phase 5.
To advance to the true phase 5 and clear the fight,
the {{mob(n="Fragment")}} must survive the phase.
Players must take care to ensure that no attacks ever hit it, apart from unavoidable raidwides.

## Summoning Hraesvelgr

After summoning the crystal, the {{mob(n="Usurper of Frost")}} summons Hraesvelger to her,
just like in phase 2 of {{gloss(k="E8S")}}.
There's no cutscene, and she remains targetable the entire time.

Right when she does so, the party's positions are snapshotted.
Without any warning, the snapshotted positions are hit
by a series of 10 consecutive {{cast(n="Akh Rhai")}} {{gloss(k="AoEs")}},
that fire in rapid succession.
They hit the same positions repeatedly, so they only need to be dodged once.

At around the sixth {{cast(n="Akh Rhai")}},
the {{mob(n="Fragment of Fate")}} emits a {{cast(n="Edge of Oblivion")}}.
The {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}} appears and becomes targetable around the ninth AoE.

## HP Balancing

Once the {{mob(n="Oracle of Darkness")}} appears, both bosses are targetable
except during the one downtime mechanic of the phase.
The party must be careful to balance their HP to within 5% of each other.
If their HP is ever more than 5% apart,
a dark tether will appear between the two bosses.

This dark tether has no immediate effect, but it upgrades the effect of {{cast(n="Morn Afah")}}.
If the HP is properly balanced, {{cast(n="Morn Afah")}} is a {{gloss(k="full-party stack")}}.
If, however, the HP is not balanced, {{cast(n="Morn Afah")}} is lethal instead,
and pierces invulnerability.
The upgraded {{cast(n="Morn Afah")}} does not turn into a raidwide, however,
so it will only kill the players within its area of effect.

After the second {{cast(n="Morn Afah")}}, there is no longer a need to balance HP.
The party can freely kill the bosses in either order.
There is also no need to keep the boss HP balanced in between the {{cast(n="Morn Afah")}} casts,
as long as they are balanced when the casts go off.
