The fight begins with Fatebreaker, the boss from
<abbr title="Eden's Promise: Anamorphosis (Savage)">E11S</abbr>.
The mechanics will be quite familiar if you've done E11S.

## Sequence 1: Cyclonic Break

Fatebreaker immediately jumps into a mechanic sequence with a Cyclonic Break castbar.
During this cast, he will be surrounded by either {{fire()}} or
{{elec()}}.
This will determine whether you need to {{fire(t="stack")}} in pairs or
{{elec(t="spread")}} during the mechanic.

After the cast completes, narrow (22.5 degree) cone AoEs go out from the boss, targeting each player.
There is no
<abbr title="An omen is a visible shape on the ground denoting an upcoming attack.">omen</abbr>
or other warning.
These inflict {{buff(b="pvuln", dur=2)}}, so any player hit by two or more will die.
The location of these cones is saved and will be used for the rest of the mechanic.

2 seconds after the first cones, a second set of cones go out on the same location.
These additionally inflict {{buff(b="ddown", dur="2m")}}.
At the same time, players will be hit by a {{fire()}} or
{{elec()}} attack.

* If it is {{fire()}}, then each {{dps()}} will be hit
  by {{fire(t="Sinsmoke")}}, a pair-stack <abbr title="Area of Effect">AoE</abbr>.
  For each dead {{dps()}}, the attack will hit a random {{supp()}} instead,
  <mark class="unconfirmed">doubling up if fewer than four players are alive.</mark>

* If it is {{elec()}}, then all players will be hit by {{elec(t="Sinsmite")}}, a
  spread AoE.

{{fire(t="Sinsmoke")}} and {{elec(t="Sinsmite")}} both inflict {{buff(b="mvuln", dur=2)}}, so
getting hit by more than one is lethal.

After the second set of cones and stack/spread, two more sets of cones go out, one after the other.
Each is rotated clockwise from the previous by 1/16th of a circle
(22.5 degrees, i.e. one cone's width).
Like the second set, these inflict {{buff(b="ddown", dur="2m")}}.

### Powder Mark Trail

Fatebreaker follows Cyclonic Break with Power Mark Trail, a single-target tankbuster that inflicts
both {{buff(b="powder-mark", dur=16)}} and {{buff(b="pvuln", dur=14)}}.
The {{buff(b="powder-mark")}} will explode if the tank dies or at the start of the next mechanic.
while the {{buff(b="pvuln")}} will cause subsequent auto-attacks to be lethal.
