The fight begins with Fatebreaker, the boss from
<abbr title="Eden's Promise: Anamorphosis (Savage)">E11S</abbr>.
The mechanics will be quite familiar if you've done E11S, although there are no light attacks.

Unless otherwise noted, any attack other than a spread, stack, raidwide, or tankbuster inflicts
{{buff(b="ddown", dur="2m")}}, and all spreads and stacks inflict {{buff(b="mvuln", dur=2)}}.

## Sequence 1: Cyclonic Break

Fatebreaker immediately jumps into a mechanic sequence with a {{cast(t="Cyclonic Break")}} cast.
During this cast, he will be surrounded by either {{fire()}} or
{{elec()}}.
This will determine whether you need to {{fire(t="stack")}} in pairs or
{{elec(t="spread")}} during the mechanic.

The attack executes a narrow (22.5 degree) conal spread targeting each player, without an
<abbr title="An omen is a visible shape on the ground denoting an upcoming attack.">omen</abbr>.
These inflict {{buff(b="pvuln", dur=2)}}, so any player hit by two or more will die.
The location of these cones is saved and will be used for the rest of the mechanic.

2 seconds after the first cones, a second set of cones go out on the same location.
These must be dodged.
At the same time, players will be hit by a {{fire()}} or {{elec()}} attack:

* If it is {{fire()}}, then each {{dps()}} will be hit
  by {{fire(t="Sinsmoke")}}, a pair-stack <abbr title="Area of Effect">AoE</abbr>.
  For each dead {{dps()}}, the attack will hit a random {{supp()}} instead,
  <mark class="unconfirmed">doubling up if fewer than four players are alive.</mark>

* If it is {{elec()}}, then all players will be hit by {{elec(t="Sinsmite")}}, a
  spread AoE.

After the second set of cones and stack/spread, two more sets of cones go out, one after the other.
Each is rotated clockwise from the previous by 1/16th of a circle
(22.5 degrees, i.e. one cone's width).
Like the second set, these must be dodged.

### Powder Mark Trail

Fatebreaker follows {{cast(t="Cyclonic Break")}} with {{cast(t="Power Mark Trail")}},
a single-target tankbuster that inflicts both {{buff(b="powder-mark", dur=16)}} and
{{buff(b="pvuln", dur=14)}}.
The {{buff(b="powder-mark")}} will explode if the tank dies or at the start of the next mechanic.
while the {{buff(b="pvuln")}} will cause subsequent auto-attacks to be lethal.

## Sequence 2: Unbroken Sky

Fatebreaker begins casting Unbroken sky, and once again is surrounded by {{fire()}} or {{elec()}}.
As before, this signals the upcoming {{fire(t="spread")}} or {{elec(t="stack")}}.

Once the cast completes, the arena will be covered in a deep fog. If you've played E11S, you will
recognize this from Prismatic Deception. Eight Fatebreaker clones will appear, one at each cardinal
and intercardinal, but due to the fog they can only be seen if you are nearby.
Right after they do so, the {{buff(b="powder-mark")}} from earlier will expire,
causing large AoE tankbusters to hit both the player originally hit by
{{cast(t="Powder Mark Trail")}} and the player nearest to them.

Three of the clones will raise their gunblades to point straight up and begin casting
{{cast(t="Blasting Zone")}},
while the rest will keep theirs facing downwards and at an angle before disappearing.
Fatebreaker reappears just before the casts complete, and begins charging a new
{{cast(t="Cyclonic Burst")}}. The {{fire()}} or {{elec()}} element need not be the same as before.

When the {{cast(t="Blasting Zone")}} completes,
the three clones will cleave in front of them in a line.
At the same time, players will be hit by an attack depending on the element
charged during the {{cast(t="Unbroken Sky")}} cast:

* {{fire(t="Sinbound Fire III")}}, a light party stack AoE.
* {{elec(t="Sinbound Thunder III")}}, a spread AoE.

When Fatebreaker finishes casting, the second {{cast(t="Cyclonic Break")}} is exactly the same as
the first, except that the element is random and may be different from before.

### Turn of the Heavens

During the execution of {{cast(t="Cyclonic Break")}}, two more clones will appear:
one just north of Fatebreaker, and one at the west side of the arena.
The one next to Fatebreaker casts {{cast(t="Turn of the Heavens")}}
with either {{fire()}} or {{elec()}},
while the one on the edge will cast {{elec(t="Burnt Strike")}}.

As the cast completes:

* Four {{fire(t="Halo of Flame")}} and four {{elec(t="Halo of Levin")}} appear
  near the outside of the arena at cardinals and intercardinals. They are always positioned with
  {{fire(t="Flame")}} halos on the west or east side, and {{elec(t="Levin")}} halos on the other.
  The halos begin casting {{cast(t="Brightfire")}}.
* Two clones appear at random intercardinals, tethered to two random players,
  and begin casting {{fire(t="Bound of Faith")}}.
  The tethered players also receive {{buff(b="prey")}} and {{buff(b="fated-burn", dur=15)}}.
* One more clone appears at the north end of the arena,
  casting {{fire(t="Burnt Strike")}}.

After the new adds begin casting, the first {{cast(t="Burnt Strike")}} goes off,
cleaving in a line from west to east.
The cleave repeats immediately, but is substantially wider the second time.
A few seconds later, the second {{cast(t="Burnt Strike")}} goes off, cleaving from north to south.
The follow-up strike will hit all players with a knockback east or west, away from the center.
These knockbacks cannot be resisted.

Shortly afterwards, all the halos explode, dealing lethal damage in a circle.
The halos that do not match the element of the {{cast(t="Turn of the Heavens")}} cast only explode
directly underneath themselves.
The halos that do match will explode inside the larger circle denoted on the floor.

At the same time, the two tethered players are lifted into the air with
{{buff(b="fetters", dur=3)}}, then charged by the adds and hit with {{fire(t="Sinsmoke")}}.
Unlike earlier, this {{fire(t="Sinsmoke")}} is a light party stack that inflicts
{{buff(b="mom", dur="2m")}} if it hits fewer than 4 players.
If the tethered player died, a random player will be targeted instead.

Finally, this sequence wraps up with {{cast(t="Burnished Glory")}},
a raidwide that inflicts a heavy {{buff(b="bleed", dur=15)}}.
